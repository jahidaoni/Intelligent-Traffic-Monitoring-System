## Introduction
The Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System is a project designed to enhance urban traffic management using advanced technologies. The system leverages real-time data analytics and machine learning algorithms to monitor traffic conditions, detect congestion, and optimize traffic flow. This project aims to reduce traffic jams, improve travel time, and enhance overall road safety.

## Features
- Real-time traffic monitoring and data collection.
- Detection of traffic congestion and incidents.
- Data visualization on a user-friendly dashboard.
- Notifications and alerts for traffic anomalies.
- Integration with existing traffic management systems.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras (for machine learning)
- Flask/Django (for web framework)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for front-end)
- SQLite/MySQL (for database management)

## Installation
To set up the Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-traffic-monitoring-system.git
                Navigate to the project directory:
                cd intelligent-traffic-monitoring-system
                Install the required dependencies:
                pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database:

Configure your database settings in config.py (or equivalent).
Run the necessary migrations or SQL scripts.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

Monitor real-time traffic data from the dashboard.
View traffic patterns and historical data.
Receive notifications for congestion or incidents.
Customize settings based on your requirements.
